      "Elephants have a highly developed sense of empathy and self-awareness. In fact, studies have shown that they are able to recognize themselves in mirrors, a cognitive ability known as \"self-awareness\" or \"mirror self-recognition\". This is a rare ability shared by only a few species, including humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins.\n",

      "In one famous study, an elephant named Sri Lanka was presented with a mirror. At first, she didn't seem to notice the reflection staring back at her. But after some time, she touched the mirror with her trunk, as if trying to figure out what this strange new entity was. Then, in a surprising moment of self-awareness, she started touching her own trunk and ears while looking at them in the mirror! This showed that she had a sense of her own body and could recognize herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This level of empathy and self-awareness is remarkable, especially considering elephants are known for their strong social bonds and complex communication. It's no wonder they're often referred to as \"the wise ones\"!\n"
